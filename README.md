# Cellular Automata for Sandpiles
This is our project report for the Computational Physics course (Winter Term 2022/23, University of Bonn).

## Contents of this Repository
This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks:
- `generate_sandpiles.ipynb`: Simulates the sandpile model and stores the generated data to disk.
- `analyze_sandpiles.ipynb`: Analyzes the generated data.

The generated data we used in our report can be found in the `avalanches*/` directories, where the suffix of the directory specifies, if closed boundary conditions and/or conservative perturbations were used.
The PDF file of our report can be found in the directory  `report/`, together with the generated figures.
